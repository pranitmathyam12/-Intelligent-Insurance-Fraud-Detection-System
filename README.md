# -Intelligent-Insurance-Fraud-Detection-System
This project is an insurance fraud detection system using knowledge graphs - it extracts data from insurance claim PDFs, builds a Neo4j graph of entities and relationships, and analyzes fraud patterns using AI
Developed an intelligent fraud detection platform that combines graph databases, LLMs, and advanced analytics to automatically identify suspicious insurance claims and uncover hidden fraud patterns.
What It Does
Transforms traditional fraud detection by mapping relationships between claims, customers, policies, and addresses in a knowledge graph, then applying AI reasoning to detect fraud rings, claim recycling, and velocity patterns.
Technical Stack
Backend: FastAPI, Neo4j (graph database), Google Gemini 2.0, Snowflake, Python
Frontend: Flask, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
Key Features
Intelligent Document Processing - Automatically extracts structured data from PDF claims
Graph-Based Pattern Detection - Identifies fraud networks using Cypher queries
LLM Reasoning - Provides explainable risk scores with actionable recommendations
Natural Language Queries - Chat with fraud data in plain English using RAG and Graph Chat
Real-Time Dashboard - Monitor fraud trends, system performance, and LLM usage
Batch Processing - Handle high-volume claim analysis efficiently
Impact
Combines graph algorithms with modern AI to deliver accurate, explainable fraud detection. Empowers investigators with visual relationship mapping and human-readable reasoning for faster, more confident decisions.
